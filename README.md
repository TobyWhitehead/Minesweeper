20/08

Crude minesweeper game

To improve:

*stick game inside a do-while loop to give the option to play multiple games

*add method to remove adjacent 0 tiles upon reveal of a 0 tile

*add flag function to mark known mine locations

*add functionality to choose grid size and number of mines

*realised that if the user inputs a tile that has already been "clicked" it will end the game before all empty tiles have been uncovered
